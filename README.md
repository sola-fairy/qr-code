## Overview

This was a pretty simple challenge, but I'm pleased with how polished something can look with just a few style elements.

## My process

### What I learned

* Use semi-transparent blurry box shadow to give containers depth
* vw and vh units are percentages (100vw is 100% of the viewport width)
* Center vertically and horizontally by giving body element ```display: flex;``` and defining size with vw & vh
* Use landmarks like ```<main>```, ```<section>```, and ```<footer>``` to improve accessibility

### Continued development

What I want to learn next.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - This is where I downloaded Outfit, the font used in the style guide.
- [Mozilla MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - A great resource for CSS guides.
